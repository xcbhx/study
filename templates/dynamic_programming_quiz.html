      <legend>1. According to the chapter, dynamic programming starts by solving:</legend>
      <label for="question1_a">
        <input type="radio" name="question1" value="The largest instance of the problem first." id="question1_a">
        The largest instance of the problem first.
      </label>
      <br />
      <label for="question1_b">
        <input type="radio" name="question1" value="A simplified version of the problem with fewer constraints." id="question1_b">
        A simplified version of the problem with fewer constraints.
        </label>
      <br />
      <label for="question1_c">
        <input type="radio" name="question1" value="Subproblems and builds up to solving the big problem." id="question1_c">
        Subproblems and builds up to solving the big problem.
      </label>
      <br />
      <label for="question1_d">
        <input type="radio" name="question1" value="Only the most critical subproblems that directly impact the final answer." id="question1_d">

      </label>
    </fieldset>
    <br />
    <fieldset>
      <legend>2. Dynamic programming is powerful because it can solve subproblems and use those answers to solve the big problem. This approach is most effective for problems that have:</legend>
      <label for="question2_a">
        <input type="radio" name="question2" value="A clear mathematical formula for the final solution." id="question2_a">
        A clear mathematical formula for the final solution.
      </label>

      <label for="question2_b">
        <input type="radio" name="question2" value="Subproblems that need to be solved independently." id="question2_b">
        Subproblems that need to be solved independently.
      </label>
      <br />
      <label for="question2_c">
        <input type="radio" name="question2" value="Subproblems that are solved multiple times if not approached carefully." id="question2_c">
        Subproblems that are solved multiple times if not approached carefully.
      </label>
      <br />
      <label for="question2_d">
        <input type="radio" name="question2" value="Solutions that depend on future, larger subproblems." id="question2_d">
        Solutions that depend on future, larger subproblems.
